/**
 * An Ambient is the class that surrounds the index, its metadata and the storage
 * devices. It helps to serialize the index and put the serialized data in an appropiate
 * location. This is how you use an ambient:
 * 1) Create the Index you want to use. 
 * 2) Create the Ambient that holds the storage device you want to use and pass
 *     the Index to it.
 * 3) Forget about the Ambient, when you want to freeze the index, use the Ambient
 *     to freeze the index so that metadata is stored properly.
 * 4) When you have closed the index and you want to use it back again, call the ambient
 *     and it will de-serialize the index and leave it ready for you to use it.
 * 
 *  Sub-classes of this class, create ambients  for different storage devices.
 * @author Arnoldo Jose Muller Molina
 * @param <I> The index that we want to create with this ambient.
